# SessionStart: Save-Point Injection
# ====================================
# Fires the exact millisecond a new agent session boots.
# Reads external state files and injects them into the fresh context.
# This is the "resume from save point" mechanism for episodic operation.
#
# Source: Anthropic long-running agent patterns, Ralph loop, OAP.
# By injecting progress.txt and features.json on boot, the fresh agent
# orients from external state — not from conversation history.
