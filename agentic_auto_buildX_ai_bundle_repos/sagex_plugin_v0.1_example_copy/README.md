# SageX

**Deterministic agent governance for Claude Code.**

Research gates. Audit loops. Approved-source enforcement. Coder/auditor cycling with zero-context review. Structural enforcement that the agent literally cannot bypass.

## What makes SageX different

Most Claude Code plugins offer *suggestions*. SageX enforces *gates*.

- **Research gate** — No code writes without approved-source research. URLs are verified, domains are whitelisted per-project, citations are logged.
- **Audit loop** — Every code change passes a 3-agent triad: zero-context reviewer (reads code cold), static analyzer (Semgrep), and orchestrator (cross-references both). All three must PASS.
- **Build loop** — Coder → Auditor → Retry, max 3 rounds. If the coder can't satisfy the auditors, the orchestrator breaks the deadlock.
- **Approved sources** — Per-project whitelists of domains, URLs, and NotebookLM notebooks. The agent reads the list. Only you modify it.
- **Edit mode** — Rules are locked by default. Explicit unlock/lock cycle for modifications, with full change logging.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add 0SxD/sagex
/plugin install sagex
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sagex:build-loop <task>` | Coder → audit → retry loop (max 3 rounds) |
| `/sagex:edit-mode` | Unlock governance for rule/source modification |
| `/sagex:lock` | Re-engage governance after edits |
| `/sagex:approve-source <type> <value> for <project>` | Add approved domain/URL/notebook |

## Philosophy

> "Instructions guide. Hooks enforce." — The agent is a probabilistic system. Under context pressure, after compaction, after 40 minutes of deep implementation, text rules aren't constraints — they're suggestions. The only way to reliably govern an LLM is through deterministic, event-based enforcement that fires every time, regardless of what the model remembers.
